					<ul>
						<li><strong>Divide-and-Conquer Problem Solving:</strong> Functions divide programs into
							smaller pieces, an approach that corresponds nicely to a divide-and-conquer approach
							to problem solving</li>
						<li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Functions provide a higher-level interface to the
							operation that the function implements. By encapsulating details, functions provide a
							programmer with a high-level view of the function's operation that could be
							implemented in multiple waysâ€”possibly by someone else.
						<li><strong>Reuse:</strong> Once a function has been created, it can be reused. If you
							write a function that locates strings in a database, then anywhere that functionality
							is required can reuse that function.</li>
						<li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Once your function is well tested, you can distribute it
							for use by other programmers.
						<li><strong>Security:</strong> One way to battle security issues is the use of functions.
							Small pieces of code can be more easily vetted, and security (and other issues) be
							more easily addressed.</li>
						<li><strong>Simplification and Readability:</strong> (duplication removal) Because a
							function provides an encapsulation, it can be used to simplify a program and make it
							more readable. Anywhere that multiple lines of code might be needed to perform a task,
							a function can replace those lines.</li>

				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Do one thing: </strong> A function should be the
							encapsulation of a single, identifiable operation. A function
							should do one thing, and do it well. Functions that try to do too
							many things are candidates to be broken into multiple functions
							(i.e., refactored).</li>
						<li><strong>Readable: </strong>A function should be readable.</li>
						<li><strong>Not Too Long: </strong>A function shouldn't be too long.
							What is "too long" depends on many things, but the idea is that if
							a function does one thing, a person should be able to read it
							easily and understand its purpose. If the function is too long,
							difficult to follow somehow, it might need to be broken into
							multiple functions (i.e., refactored).</li>
						<li><strong>Reusable: </strong>A function should be reusable in
							contexts other than the program it was written for originally. If
							possible, the function should be self-contained and not dependent
							on some nuance of the calling program. If it has dependencies,
							then those dependencies should be made clear so that others can
							use it more easily.</li>
						<li><strong>Complete: </strong>A function should be complete, in
							that it works in all potential situations. If you write a function
							to perform one thing, you should make sure that all the cases
							where it might be used are taken into account. It is often the
							case that the core of the function is very straightforward, but
							handling all the cases it might encounter requires supporting
							code.</li>
						<li><strong>Refactoring: </strong>A function should be complete, in
							that it works in all potential situations. If you write a function
							to perform one thing, you should make sure that all the cases where
							it might be used are taken into account. It is often the case that
							the core of the function is very straightforward, but handling all
							the cases it might encounter requires supporting code.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Click!</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Low Coupling: </strong>Functions should be as independent
							as possible from other modules, so that changes to one function
							don't heavily impact functions.</li>
						<li><strong>High Cohesion: </strong>In a highly cohesive function
							every line of code works towards to purpose of the function and
							<em>only</em> the purpose of the function.
