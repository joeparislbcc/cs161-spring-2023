				<p style="text-align: left;">With tools like <code>functions</code>, <code>lists</code>,
					<code>dictionaries</code>, and other data structures in your
					toolbox you can do an even better job of decomposing large problems into smaller, solvable ones.

				<h3>Divide-and-Conquer</h3>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p style="text-align: left;">The divide-and-conquer strategy is a simple one: break a large
					problem into smaller pieces and solve each piece individually. Then, you construct the
					overall solution by combining the smaller, solved parts.</p>

				<h3>Top-Down Design</h3>
				<p>A <strong>top-down</strong> approach, aka <span class="lbGold">stepwise design</span> or <span
						class="lbGold">stepwise refinement</span>, essentially means to break down a system to
					gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion.</p>

				<h3>Bottom-Up Design</h3>
				<p>A <strong>bottom-up</strong> approach is the piecing together of systems to give rise to
					more complex systems, thus making the original systems sub-systems of the emergent system</p>

				<h4>In software development, the top-down and bottom-up approaches play a key role...</h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Top-down approaches emphasize planning and a
						<span class="lbGold">complete</span> understanding of the system.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">It is inherent that no coding can begin until a
						sufficient level of detail has been reached in the design of at least some part of the system.</li>
				</ul>

			<section data-auto-animate>
				<h4>In software development, the top-down and bottom-up approaches play a key role...</h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Top-down approaches are implemented by attaching
						the stubs in place of the module.</li>
					<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">This, however, delays testing of the ultimate
						functional units of a system until significant design is complete.</li>
				</ul>

			<section data-auto-animate>
				<p>In the software development process, the top-down and bottom-up approaches play a key role...</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Bottom-up emphasizes coding and early testing,
						which can begin as soon as the first module has been specified.</li>
					<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">This approach, however, runs the risk that modules
						may be coded without having a clear idea of how they link to other parts of the system,
						and that such linking may not be as easy as first thought.</li>
				</ul>

			<section data-auto-animate>
				<p>In the software development process, the top-down and bottom-up approaches play a key role...</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment fade-in">Re-usability of code is one of the main benefits
						of the bottom-up approach.</li>

				<h3>The Rules of Programming</h3>

					<li>Think before you program!</li>
					<li>A program is a human-readable essay on problem-solving that also happens to execute on a computer.</li>
					<li>The best way to improve your programming and problem-solving skills is to practice!</li>
					<li>A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.</li>
					<li>Test your code, often and thoroughly!</li>

				<h4>(so far)</h4>
				<ol start="6">
					<li>If it was hard to write, it is probably hard to read. Add a comment.</li>
					<li>All input is evil until proven otherwise.</li>
					<li>A function should do one thing (and do it well).</li>
