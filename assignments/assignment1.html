		<p>This assignment is meant to be a gentle introduction to Python and to help get you ready to
			tackle the work in this class.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><strong>The Great Lakes are How Big?</strong></p>

				<p>The Great Lakes in the United States contain roughly 22% of the world's fresh surface
					water (22,810 km<sup>3</sup>). It is hard to conceive how much water that is. Write a
					program to calculate how deep it would be if all the water in the Great Lakes was spread
					evenly across the 48 contiguous U.S. states. You will need to do some Internet research to
					determine the area of that region.</p>

				<p>Save your program in a file named <code>lastname_firstname_great_lakes.py</code></p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p><strong>Where is Voyager 1?</strong></p>

				<p>The Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched September 15, 1977, is the farthest traveling
					earth-made object. It is presently on the outer edges of our solar system. The
					<a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA update page</a> on September
					25, 2009, reported it as being a distance of approximately 16,637,000,000 miles from the
					Sun, traveling away from the Sun at 38,241 miles/hour.
				</p>
				<p>Write a program that will prompt the user for an integer number that indicates the number
					of days after 9/25/09. You will calculate the distance of Voyager from the Sun using the
					numbers from 9/25/09 (assume that velocity is constant) plus the entered number of days
					and report:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Distance in miles</li>
					<li>Distance in kilometers</li>
					<li>Distance in Astronomical Units</li>
					<li>Round trip time for radio communication in hours. Radio waves travel at the speed of
						light.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Again, you will probably need to do some Internet research to compute some of those
					conversions (unless you just happen to know the speed of light or how many miles are in an
					AU, for example).
				</p>

				<p>Save your program in a file named <code>lastname_firstname_great_voyager.py</code></p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p><strong>Population Estimation</strong></p>

				<p>The U.S. Census provides information on its <a href="https://www.census.gov/" target="_blank">web page</a>
					about the current U.S. population as well as approximate rates of change.
				</p>

				<p>Three rates of change are provided:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>a birth every 7 seconds</li>
					<li>a death every 13 seconds</li>
					<li>a new immigrant every 35 seconds</li>
				</ul>

				<p>These are obviously approximations of birth, death, and immigration rates, but they can
					assist in providing population estimates in the near term.
				</p>

				<p>Write a program that takes years as input (as an integer) and prints out an estimated
					population (as an integer). Get the current US population from
					<a href="https://www.census.gov/" target="_blank">the Census Bureau</a> web page, and
					assume that there are exactly 365 days in a year.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Note that the rate units are in seconds.</p>
				<p>When completing this project You will
					also need to calculate the approximate rate of change for the population
				</p>

				<p>Save your program in a file named <code>lastname_firstname_population.py</code></p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Assignment Notes:</h4>

		<p><strong>Coding standards 1&ndash;6</strong> will be enforced for this assignment.</p>

		<p>Because this is the first week of the term and the college is closed Friday this assignment
			will be <strong>due Wednesday, April 12</strong>. Please note that this is a rare exception to
			the usual due date of Sunday on the week the assignment is given. There will be a new
			assignment given on Monday, April 10 so I encourage you to get started on this one as soon as
			possible. You may always email me if you have any questions, or bring them to class next week.
		</p>

		<p>Submit <em>only</em> the following files via Moodle before the due date:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><code>lastname_firstname_great_lakes.py</code></li>
			<li><code>lastname_firstname_great_voyager.py</code></li>
			<li><code>lastname_firstname_population.py</code></li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Important</h5>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Do not</strong> zip your files together.</li>
			<li><strong>Do not</strong> include any files other than what is listed above.</li>
			<li><strong>Do not</strong> use any spaces in your file names.</li>
			<li><strong>Do not</strong> use any capital letters in your file names.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Submissions that fail to follow the above rules will not be graded and will result in a zero for the assignment.
